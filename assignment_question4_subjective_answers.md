## Goal

The target is to plot time taken to fit and predict the Decision tree model against varying N - number of samples and M - number of features.
We have plotted the time taken to fit and predict the model against M and N. We have also plotted the standard deviation in time taken to fit and predict the model against M and N.

## Results
For each type of Decision Tree i.e.,

1. Discrete Input and Discrete output
2. Discrete Input and Real output
3. Real Input and Discrete output
4. Real Input and Real output
   
We have 4 plots, one for each of the following

1. Average Time to fit the model
2. Average Time to predict the model
3. Standard Deviation in Time to fit the model
4. Standard Deviation in Time to predict the model
So, in total we have 16 plots.

## Discrete input and Discrete Output

As we can see from the above plot, the time taken to fit the model increases with the number of samples and number of features. The time taken to predict the model is dependent on the input. The prediction ends soon in some cases and takes a lot of time in some cases. But the average time taken to predict the model is almost increases with respect to the number of samples and number of features.
